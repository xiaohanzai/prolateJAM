# prolateJAM
I am developing a prolate version for the Jeans Anisotropic Multi-Gaussian Expansion (JAM) method.

Version 1 uses the following beta function: $\beta = \beta_0 + a\frac{R}{R+R_a}$, where $R_a$ is a scale radius. Note this $R$ is the cylindrical $R$, not the spherical $r$. No $z$-dependence of $\beta$ is included in this first version.
